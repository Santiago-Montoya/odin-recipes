# odin-recipes

In this html project I am building a website with several links to recipes, with my new knowledge in Git, Github and HTML.

The purpose of this exercise is to test the knowledge I have learnt throughout these past lessons.

It is also important for me to test and try to build things by myself simply by following written instructions. This will solidify my knowledge.
